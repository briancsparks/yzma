Ah, how shall I do it?
Oh, I know.
I'll turn him into a flea, a harmless, little flea,
and then I'll put that flea in a box,
and then I'll put that box inside of another box,
and then I'll mail that box to myself, and when it arrives...

**I'll smash it with a hammer!**

It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you!
Genius, I say!
